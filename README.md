# GodotSvg

GodotSvg is a Godot Android plugin to read SVG files, which can be used as images in a Godot application.
This plugin is made possible because of the [Godot Engine](https://https://godotengine.org/) and the
SVG library done by [AndroidSvg, com.caverock.androidsvg-aar](https://bigbadaboom.github.io/androidsvg/)
